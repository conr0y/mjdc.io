# Hello World

This is the first post on Conroy Studio.

Nothing fancy here — just a simple site built with HTML, CSS, and a bit of markdown. No frameworks, no build tools, no nonsense.

## Why this setup?

- **Plain HTML/CSS** — fast, predictable, zero dependencies
- **Markdown for blog posts** — easy to write, easy to read
- **No build step** — edit a file, refresh the browser

## What's next

More posts, more projects. Stay tuned.
